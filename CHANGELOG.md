CHANGELOG for 3.0
=================

* The abstract templates and ready-to-use generic implementations of SourceAdapters and DestinationAdapters in the
  [webfactory/content-mapping-*](https://github.com/search?q=webfactory%2Fcontent-mapping) packages. The Mapper usually
  is very specific for your project, so you probably want to implement it in your application.
* The PropelToSolrMapper has been completely removed, as it depended on an outdated library.


CHANGELOG for 2.0
=================

Rewritten from scratch; earlier versions are neither documented nor supported. For usage, please see [README](README.md).
